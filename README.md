# individual.jl

individual.jl is a package which uses [Catlab.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/),
especially attributed C-Sets to build a set of data types and methods useful for building
individual-based epidemiological models. It is inspired by the R software [individual](https://mrc-ide.github.io/individual/).
